# EyeExercise
The project creates a web page with two eyes with eye ball mimicking your mouse movement.

Description: 
Eye Exercise :- The project creates a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement.This project requires the skills in javascript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.The 2 eyes will follow the mass movements  as we move the mass the mass events will be picked up. And we are moving the eye balls to match the mass.
Installation:
 Make sure all the files are in a directory as listed here:
1. index.html and eyes.js ,styles.csh files in the main folder.
 Open index.html file in any of the browser by 1) dragging and dropping the index.html file into the browser window or 2) typing "file:///index.html" in the browser window.2)use the styles.css to design the eye and font colors.3) In eyes.js we will match the mass movements and we need to use  setInterval() to do all the iterations.
RoadMap:
Â Later I am hoping to improve my code so that I can create at least one or more  additional features added to the eye exercise project.
