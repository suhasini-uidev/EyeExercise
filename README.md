# Eye Exercise:-

Description:
Eye Exercise :- This  project creates a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement.  Front End development skills demonstrated in this exercise are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this dynamic experience.  The 2 eyes will follow the mouse movements.  As we move the mouse, the mouse events will be picked up and then  we are moving the eye balls to match the mouse movements.

Installation:
Make sure all the files are in a directory as listed here:
1. indexSolution.html ,eyesSolution.js  and stylesSolutions.css files in the main folder,<Eyeexercise>
2. Open indexSolution.html file in any of the browser by
    1. dragging and dropping the indexSolution.html file into the browser window you can see how the two eye balls will move according to the mouse movement. 
    2. use styleSolution.css to design the eye, eyeball position, width, height, eye movements of the eyeball and applying the colors to the eye,  eyeballs.
    3. In eyesSolution.js we will match the mouse to the eye ball  movements and we need to use  setInterval() to do all the iterations.

RoadMap:
Later I am hoping to improve my code so that I can create at least one or more  additional features added to the eyes.
