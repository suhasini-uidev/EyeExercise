Eye Exercise

Description:
This project creates an illustion of Eye Exercise by moving the eyeball.  It creates a web page with two eyes wherein the eyeball follows your mouse movement. As we move the mouse, the mouse events will be tracked and using that we move the eye balls to match the mouse movements.

Front End development skills demonstrated in this exercise are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this dynamic experience.  

File Structure and Logic:
1. indexSolution.html file is the main file callin/invoking all other files.
2. use styleSolution.css to design the eye, eyeball position, width, height, eye movements of the eyeball and applying the colors to the eye and eyeballs.
3. eyesSolution.js has the dynamic coding that will match the mouse to the eye ball  movements. We use  setInterval() to do all the iterations.

Installation:
1. Download the code from git, https://github.com/suhasini-uidev/EyeExercise
2. Make sure all the files are in a directory as listed here: indexSolution.html, eyesSolution.js and stylesSolutions.css files in the main folder, <Eyeexercise>

Usage:
Open indexSolution.html file in any of the browser by dragging and dropping the indexSolution.html file into the browser window.  You will see the two eye balls move according to the mouse movement. 

RoadMap:
Later I am hoping to improve my code so that I can create at least one or more additional features added to the eyes.
